Credit card fraud is one of the most pressing cybersecurity threats today, affecting individuals and businesses worldwide. Fraudsters use techniques like phishing, data breaches, card skimming, and hacking to gain unauthorized access to credit card information, leading to financial losses and identity theft. To combat this growing issue, machine learning has become a key tool in detecting fraudulent transactions by analyzing patterns and anomalies in financial data.

This project focuses on developing a credit card fraud detection model using machine learning techniques. By exploring a real-world dataset, we apply data cleaning, exploratory analysis, dataset balancing, and PCA transformation to improve classification accuracy. The goal is to create a model that efficiently identifies fraudulent transactions while minimizing false positives, contributing to enhanced security in digital financial transactions.
